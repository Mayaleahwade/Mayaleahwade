# Hi, Iâ€™m Maya (@Mayaleahwade)ðŸ‘‹

I am a MSc student in the Department of Forest and Conservation Sciences at the University of British Columbia. I'm a part of Dr. Isla Myers-Smith's research group (Team Shrub!). 

I'm passionate about biodiversity and ecology. My current favourite animal is the harbour seal (_Phoca vitulina_) but this changes frequently (even week by week!).
Really, I'm just amazed by the incredible diversity of life on our planet.

My current research focuses on understanding how climate-induced shrub expansion impacts animal species composition and habitat use in Arctic tundra ecosystems. 
During my undergrad, I worked on developing a cryopreservation protocol for the endangered shortnose sturgeon's (_Acipenser brevirostrum_) oogonial stem cells as an _ex-situ_ conservation strategy with Dr. Matthew Litvak.

# ðŸ”¬ Research Interests
- Climate Change and Ecosystem Dynamics: I am particularly interested in how warming temperatures influence vegetation change, such as the encroachment of shrubs into the tundra, and how this affects wildlife.
- Wildlife Monitoring: My research utilizes wildlife cameras and autonomous recording units (ARUs) to monitor species occupancy, biodiversity, and activity patterns in the northern Yukon.
- Data Analysis and Ecological Modeling: I enjoy using statistical and computational tools to analyze ecological data, seeking to unravel patterns in habitat use and species interactions under changing environmental conditions.

# ðŸŒ¿ Current Project
I am studying the expansion of shrubs into Arctic tundra and its implications for wildlife habitat use. This work involves expanding a network of wildlife cameras and ARUs across tundra sites to track animal occupancy and habitat use as the climate warms.
